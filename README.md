## Description of myself_v23

I am an Electrical & Computer Engineer student at AUTh (Greece), with the vision of working at software engineering (or similar) positions at accomplished companies 💯. My capabilities and passion with IT have been there since childhood 💻. I believe my greatest powers to be complex problem analyzing and step-by-step solving using all the engineering knowledge I have amassed through the years ⚡. Currently striving to leverage my software development skills and continue to collect every piece of knowledge I can to become a better engineer 🌱.

## Current patch notes

🔭 Working on my thesis on "Detection of smoking events from inertial data collected in free-living environments with the use of a smartwatch". 

🎯 Also spending my free time trying to convince myself to develop personal side-projects!
