## Description of myself_v24

I am an Electrical & Computer Engineering graduate from AUTh (Greece), with the vision of working at software engineering (or similar) positions at accomplished companies 💯. My capabilities and passion with IT have been there since childhood 💻. I believe my greatest powers to be complex problem analyzing and step-by-step solving using all the engineering knowledge I have amassed through the years ⚡. Currently striving to leverage my software development skills and continue to collect every piece of knowledge I can to become a better engineer 🌱.

## Current patch notes

💂‍♂ Fulfilling my military service obligations until 18/11/2021.

🔭 Working on the publication and presentation of my first paper for the 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC). Based on my diploma thesis, the paper examines the feasibility of objectively measuring smoking behavior using inertial sensors found in common smartwatches.

🎯 Also spending my free time trying to convince myself to develop personal side-projects!
